# Expense Tracker

## Persistence

Entities and repositories are grouped into the `user`, `category`, `transaction`
and `budget` packages. Monetary values use `BigDecimal` and map to
`DECIMAL(15,2)`. Budget months use `LocalDate` and must be the first calendar day
of the month. Creation timestamps are initialized before the first insert.

Category, transaction and budget repositories provide `findAllByUserId`,
`findByIdAndUserId`, `existsByIdAndUserId`, `updateByIdAndUserId` and `deleteByIdAndUserId`.
The service layer must supply the authenticated user's ID; never trust a user ID
from a request. Updates and deletes use explicit queries with both `id` and
`userId` predicates. Use `updateByIdAndUserId` for updates rather than saving a
modified entity. Ownership IDs cannot be changed through setters.
Database foreign keys also require transactions and budgets to reference a
category belonging to the same user.

`JpaRepository` also exposes inherited methods without a user filter, such as
`findAll`, `findById`, `deleteById`, and batch operations. Do not use those methods
for user-owned data. Use inherited `save`/`saveAndFlush` only for new entities
whose ownership was assigned by the service. The repository interfaces alone do not derive the current
user from Spring Security.

## Verification

Run `./mvnw verify` (`.\mvnw.cmd verify` on Windows). The repository integration
tests use MySQL from `application.properties`, run Flyway and Hibernate schema
validation, and roll back their test data. They verify isolation between two
users, exact monetary values, scoped deletions and category ownership constraints.
They require an available MySQL server and the `expense_tracker` database.
Use a separate test database by setting `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`,
`SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME` and `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` when running tests.
